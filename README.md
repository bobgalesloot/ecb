The code backfills ESTR = EONIA − 8.5 basis points.
It assumes a 31 December 1998 EONIA equal to the first published value.
It generates an unrounded compounded euro short-term rate index (1 Oct 2019 = 100): indexur.
It also generates an extended series with accrual during weekends and holidays: indexwa.
The latter can be used, for example, for series/analyses based on calendar month-ends.
